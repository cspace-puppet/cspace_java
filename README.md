cspace_java
===========

A puppet module for ensuring an Oracle JDK 7 exists, as a
dependency for setting up and managing a CollectionSpace system.

**Please make changes on the appropriate branch for the CollectionSpace
version to be installed**: e.g. `v4.2`, `v4.1`. And create new branches
for new CollectionSpace versions. (The `master` branch is now deprecated.)
